					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p> 
					My name is Silvi Patel and I am currently a student at the University of South Carolina. I am majoring in psychology and biology on a pre-med track. Even though most of my time is taken up by classes, I still find time to do fun activities outside of school. I am a part of countless clubs on campus with my favorites being book club and my sorority, ESA. It's a service sorority so it gives me the opportunity to give back to the community while meeting new people and making friends. Other hobbies include painting and reading (as you can tell from the book club). I also love hanging out with my friends and going to coffee shops.My favorite season is winter (even though my favorite place is the beach), I'm scared on tiny fish, and my favorite drink is anything with caffiene.

					<span id="expand"></span><span id="more">I was actually born in India and I immigrated to America with my family when I was 8 years old. I have a little brother who I have made into a mini version of me and he's like my favorite person ever. Also other fun facts are that I have been wanting to adopt a cat for the longest time, but I can't just yet because my mom is allergic; I can speak 5 languages and I am currently learning 2 more; I have synesthesia which is where a person sees letters and numbers in color; and my ideal day is reading a book on a beach with my friends while drinking iced coffee and eating watermelon.

					<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
					<p>
					I'm that type of person that has too many aspirations and dreams that I have difficulty picking what I want to do. However, career wise, my current plans are to attend graduate school for biomedial sciences or clinical psychology, I haven't decided yet, because I want to gain more research experience before moving on to medical school. I don't need to attend grad school before medical school, but I want to develop those research skills necessary in medical school and have a post-bacc degree incase something goes wrong with my plan for medical school. I plan on either going into psychiatry or neurosurgery, but that entirely depends on my journey through medical school. I do however want to be a doctor, and it has been my dream to be one since I was a kid.

					<span id="dots"></span><span id="see">If I wasn't becoming a doctor, I would have definetly gone into Aerospace Engineering because I really wanted to work for NASA growing up, and then later becoming an astronaut. My plans for the future after or even during medical school include opening up a book shop in some coastal town that is also a coffee shop where I can be a book keeper and a barista. Ultimately, I just want to live a slow life in the future apart from being a doctor, and I also just want to be able to conduct my own research in anything that involves brain function and mental disorders. My future aspirations may be very random, but I'm that type of person that has the determination to do almost anything so I look forward to how I am going to achieve all my goals, and live my dream life.
